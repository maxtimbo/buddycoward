Congressman Backdoor Buddy Coward Carter is a stain in our currect House of Representatives. He refuses to hold a town hall meeting and face his constituency. This website was built to help people find resources to contact his offices and hold Backdoor Buddy accountable.

## His office can be reached at  
# (202) 225-5831

Call Buddy Coward's office and tell them we require a town hall meeting.

Another reason to call Buddy Coward's office comes from user u/notdonmori on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/savannah/comments/1j5pcxg/call_buddy_carter_and_tell_him_you_dont_support/):  

> Republicans need $850 Billion in cuts to justify their new tax bill. The largest estimate of "fraud", "waste" and "abuse" in Medicaid is about $50 Billion. Where are Republicans going to get the rest? From Medicaid services that you and I and every other normal person in Chatham County depend on.

>  
> Tell Representative Carter you DO NOT support cutting Medicaid. If they reference the fraud, waste and abuse, ask for receipts. Ask how much they estimate is FW&A. Ask how they plan on getting the rest of the money.

If you're interested and motivated enough, you may also want to get a bumper sticker made or put up some yard signs. Thanks to u/Fortuna_Ex_Machina for creating these images. You can find the download links below and use them to create on any signage website. I found [Build A Sign](https://www.buildasign.com), but you may know of a better company.
