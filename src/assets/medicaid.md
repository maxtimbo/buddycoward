Tell Buddy Coward [you don't support cutting Medicaid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/savannah/comments/1j5pcxg/call_buddy_carter_and_tell_him_you_dont_support/):  

> Republicans need $850 Billion in cuts to justify their new tax bill. The largest estimate of "fraud", "waste" and "abuse" in Medicaid is about $50 Billion. Where are Republicans going to get the rest? From Medicaid services that you and I and every other normal person in Chatham County depend on.

> Tell Representative Carter you DO NOT support cutting Medicaid. If they reference the fraud, waste and abuse, ask for receipts. Ask how much they estimate is FW&A. Ask how they plan on getting the rest of the money.
